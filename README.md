Turn a JSON script into a vertical short video. TTS + Whisper caption alignment + Remotion render, all automated. Built for people who'd rather write code than open a video editor.

## What you get

- **One-command pipeline** — `./scripts/render.sh <project>` runs TTS, alignment, metadata build, and Remotion render end-to-end.
- **Metadata-driven timing** — slide durations computed from actual WAV length, no manual frame counting.
- **Composable slides** — `cover`, `text`, `code` compositions out of the box, each drop-in replaceable.
- **Dual TTS backends** — Fish Audio API (default, excellent Chinese cloning) or local IndexTTS2 (free, GPU required).
- **Word-level captions** — faster-whisper produces frame-accurate caption tracks that burn into the render.
- **Remotion Studio hot reload** — iterate on compositions in React with live preview.

## How it works

```
script.json ──▶ TTS ──▶ *.wav ──▶ Whisper align ──▶ captions.json
                                                            │
                                  build-metadata ◀──────────┘
                                         │
                                         ▼
                                  Remotion render ──▶ out/full.mp4
```

**Input** (`examples/my-first/script.json`):
```json
{
  "title": "My first AI video",
  "fps": 30,
  "width": 1080,
  "height": 1920,
  "slides": [
    { "type": "cover", "title": "Hello world", "subtitle": "in 10 seconds" },
    { "type": "text",  "text": "This is my first AI-rendered video.",
      "voice_text": "This is my first AI-rendered video." },
    { "type": "code",  "language": "ts",
      "code": "const video = await kit.render(script);",
      "voice_text": "One function call, one video file." }
  ]
}
```

**Run**:
```bash
./scripts/render.sh examples/my-first
```

**Output**: `examples/my-first/out/full.mp4` — a 1080×1920 vertical video with narration and captions, timed exactly to the generated audio.

## Setup

**Clone and install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/runesleo/claude-video-kit.git
cd claude-video-kit
cd remotion && npm install && cd ..
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY, FISH_AUDIO_VOICE_ID
```

**Any AI coding agent:**
Point your agent at `docs/quickstart.md` and `examples/schoger-demo/`. The whole pipeline is four scripts — an agent can read, modify, and run it without framework knowledge.

## Requirements

- Node 20+
- Python 3.10+
- ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg`)
- Fish Audio API key (default TTS) — or skip it and use the macOS `say` fallback for local testing
- (Optional) CUDA GPU if you want to run IndexTTS2 locally

That's it. No video editor, no recording gear, no timeline.

## Supported slide types

| Type | Purpose | Required fields | Optional fields |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `cover` | Opening / closing cards | `title` | `subtitle` |
| `text` | Narrated text slide | `text`, `voice_text` | `voice` |
| `code` | Code-as-video blocks | `code`, `language`, `voice_text` | `voice` |

Add your own by dropping a new composition into `remotion/src/compositions/` and registering it in `Root.tsx`. See `docs/quickstart.md`.

## Known limitations (v0.1)

- No automatic cover generator — covers are whatever the `cover` slide renders
- No B-roll / video clip support — slides are still-frame + audio + captions
- Single voice per video (though per-slide voice override is in the schema)
- IndexTTS2 backend is a placeholder — script is documented, wiring is left to the user due to CUDA environment variance
- Chinese is the primary tested language; other languages work but captioning quality depends on Whisper model size

## Roadmap

**Pipeline**
- [ ] v0.2 — AI-generated B-roll clips (SDXL / video models for visual variety)
- [ ] v0.3 — Auto cover image generator (1080×1920, platform-aware)
- [ ] v0.4 — Multi-voice conversations (multiple voice IDs per script)

**Compositions**
- [ ] Chart slide (render data as animated SVG)
- [ ] Diff slide (before/after comparison, Schoger-style)
- [ ] Diagram slide (Mermaid → animated reveal)

**Tooling**
- [ ] Web UI — non-coders can edit scripts in a browser
- [ ] `kit init` CLI — scaffold new video projects without copying examples

**API** (planned)
- [ ] REST endpoint for render-as-a-service — POST a script, receive an MP4
